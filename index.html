            Why Dakar
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Dakar, the city of the African Renaissance Monument
        </h3>
        <p>
            The concept of ‘African Renaissance’ refers to a popular Pan-African philosophical and political
            ideology centred on the role of Africa in a globalised world from the start of the 21st century. It is
            used to describe the continent moving onwards from the colonial period of struggle against
            oppression to a new era of ‘re-birth’ within the global scene. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept was Inspired largely by
            the work of two Senegalese intellectuals, Cheikh Anta Diop and Léopold Sédar Senghor, who,
            during the 1930s in Paris, developed the literary framework of ‘negritude’ to define the Black
            world, a cultural and identity-based concept rather than a political one. The concept of African
            Renaissance is paradigmatic, it shows how politicians appropriate, in a more or less explicit
            manner, the past. It allows us to understand how political concepts circulate, change and take
            directions contrary to their original meaning.

                        Ruled in succession by the Portuguese, Dutch, English and French, its architecture is characterized by the contrast
                        between the grim slave-quarters and the elegant houses of the slave traders. Today it continues to serve as a reminder
                        of human exploitation and as a sanctuary for reconciliation.

                The Mosque of Divinity built 1997, is a mosque located in Ouakam, Senegal. It is a structure with two minarets. The
                mosque provides a view of the Atlantic Ocean, as the mosque lies near the shore, at the Corniche-Ouest

                Visitors consider the mosque a must-see in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, not only for its sheer size and the panorama
                that it offers, but as a unique architectural monument that melds elements of modernism with traditional Islamic design.

                    discover four thematic floors. Each level exposes the social and technological advances transmitted by black
                    civilizations in chronological order.
